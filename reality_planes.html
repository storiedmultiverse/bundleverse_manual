reality_planes.html

Prefabricated missions and manifestations offered by Bundleverse seem to make up a fairly
random collection of items often unrelated
to each other. To make sense out of this collection, let me introduce a mental construct, a story overarching these
missions and manifestations and, hopefully, making them easier to comprehend and use.


To be specific, let's introduce several realms (called also reality planes) -
Environmental, Rocks and Plants, Animals, Humans, Avatars,
Gods, and the realm of Beings. Assume further these reality planes to be ordered into a hierarchy -
every next level of the reality extends
the previous one except the top level of Beings which is meant to be a special realm outside the space of rules and
logic. Another special realm, the bottom one, called Environmental, is an umbrella term referring to a
bunch of different realms
(e.g. Natural, Financial,Political, Ethnical, Professional).
Unlike other realms (often having some kind of a life-form weaved in) environmental planes of the reality are made out
of
life-less forms.
<br><br>


Each plane of the reality is characterised with special states-of-being which define these planes.
People can either fully experience these states-of-being or have some glimpses of them by going through
special practices (called missions).
Environmental realms again stand out, since practices for these realms
are often designed and implemented through special sciences.
<br><br>

Life-forms weaved into the planes of the reality have a secondary, assistive role. They represent states-of-being
associated with these plane and help us to describe and understand these states.
<br><br>

The term "state-of-being" could be referring to various configurations and superpositions of the mental,
psychological, spiritual, aesthetic, ethical states which we can experience to various degrees under
certain conditions. Those conditions could be associated with
people excelling in sports, music, science, art, overcoming
difficulties and achieving goals, exhibiting virtuous behavior, playing and enjoying games, maditating,
playing etcetera.
At the higher planes of the reality these states-of-being may have
nothing to do with someone's thinking, desiring, or feeling. They could be referring, for example,
to some abstract state of a positive,
calm, existential radiance which belongs to higher planes and may or may not fit exactly into the
realm of humans.
<br><br>

To flesh out the structure of the connections between people and these planes of the reality
(and explain the process of the instantiation), I’ll assume a bundle
representation of a person as a collection of environmental, biophysical, psychological, intellectual, social, spiritual
and transcendental dimensions. Furthermore, I’ll postulate also a mapping from this bundle of personality to
various planes of the reality (see table below). This mapping builds on an assumption that our actions,
thoughts, feelings, sentiments accumulated
through time (and integrated into an overarching conceptual framework) connect us to various planes of the reality (a
venerated idea exploited by many teachings). These connections are established through the personality bundle and by
purposefully changing the shape of that bundle (for example, through the development of individual character traits
associated with the dimensions of that bundle) one can change the strength (or weights) of these connections.
In other words, people of different characters connect to different realms
and they can changes these connections by by changing their character.
<br><br>

Since reality plains combine into hierarchical structures, instantiating the top level realm implies
instantiation of the nested realms too. Hence, instead of being connected to a single plane, people connect to
a range of planes. The strength of such connections varies across these planes.
<br><br>

Strong connection to a particular realm implies a tendency for a
person to behave, think, feel, and perceive surrounding world in a way consistent with that realm.
In terms of the ISOM vocabulary, we say we have delivered features characteristic of the particular realm
(i.e. we have instantiated it), when we experience states-of-being characteristic of that realm.
<br><br>

The reader might be wondering at this point why we need these reality planes anyway? They are defined in terms of
states-of-being a person can experience over the course of his lifetime. What is the point of introducing those
extra entities?
<br><br>

The point of having these reality planes is that now we have a placeholder for states-of-beings
independent of our material or bodily manifestations. With this infrastructure in place, we can
push our story-line further and assume that a person can reincarnate into another realm in the future
when he is gone from the realm of humans.
In other words, we assume that people can transform into an idealistic immaterial state-of-being
allocated somewhere else outside their body.
If this state-of-being has a strong association with
the human or higher planes of the reality, then that person reincarnates to the current plane
or moves up to higher planes, otherwise he goes down.
Hence, the point to take home- take care of yourself.
<br><br>




Can we prove these planes of the reality are really real?
<br><br>
Well... it depends, of course, on how we define the term "really real" and what counts as a sufficient proof here,
but, in general (in most cases) the short answer to this question, I think, will be that we cannot.
Furthermore, according to natural sciences, for example, it
does not make sense to even suggest that such planes exist.
There is nothing to prove because they don't exist by the definition - full stop.
However, if we change the context for our discussion and take onboard the Storied Multiverse perspective
(teemed with various kinds of instantiated objects),
then it would make a perfect sense for us to suggest that these realms either already exist or, if they don't,
they can be instantiated in the future. According to this multiverse vision, the reality of these planes is
a plausible hypothesis because this framework is based on a very flexible definition of the real entity.
Now don't be confused here, even in Multiverse we still cannot prove these realms 100%, but
given the complexity of the subject matter we shall never expect a clear cut, unequivocal answers here.
Having a framework where the existence of these realms becomes a plausible hypothesis is already a
great achievement which can trigger a huge difference in the way we perceive and handle these realms.
Another point to make here is that regardless existential status of these realms we don't need
anyone's permission or approval to play with them. Fiction worlds could be as much entertaining
as the real ones (or even more) - they have their own value.
Having said this, an assumption that these realms are real,
i believe, sets the whole game on a qualitatively new level. If it is true then by running missions
we might be instantiating and maintaining the new worlds.
<br><br>

The list of the realms presented here
is not immutable. You can design your own realm and then instantiate and maintain it through your own missions (if you
wish so). Note that by following conventions and taking for granted a certain description of the self and the universe,
we are already participating in this game and are connected to certain realms.
Connection to a new realm implies the disconnection from the original one.
<br><br>

Let’s run a few examples to illustrate the relationship between these reality planes, their manifestations, dimensions
of
personality, and missions (see table below).
<br><br>

<h3>Environmental</h3>
Let’s start with the planes of the reality populated with non-living forms (ie natural, financial, political,
professional, ethnical domains). Each of these planes has a counterpart in the personality bundle (called collectively
as environmental dimension). Having all other aspects of personality (apart from the environmental) neglected,
transforms a person into a passive entity, conditioned by these external environmental factors. Like a formless dust he
will need a vessel to maintain his shape. Without such vessel he turns into a formless pile of dirt with no meaning and
no purpose. On the other hand, if the environmental dimensions of personality are neglected and all other dimensions are
looked after, you may end up with a poor, blind saint bumping into the walls of the unknown and not being able to look
even after himself, let alone to help others. Environmental planes today are increasingly handled by special sciences,
but general public can also partake in maintaining these realms by monitoring/observing, learning, and working with
them.

<h3>Rocks and Plants</h3>
The realm of Rocks and Plants is associated with the physical and biological dimensions of a person and is populated
with a low-level life forms such as Golems and Groots . To instantiate and maintain this realm, one takes care of his
bodily health, power, appearance. If all other dimensions of personality are neglected, such person transforms into a
Golem or Groot. On the other hand, if he does not care about his body at all, he gets sick and dies.

<h3>Animals</h3>
Having advanced both biophysical and psychological dimensions of personality but lacking social dimension projects a
person into the realm of animals. You can meet here Dragons (psychotic personalities with a lot of energy but little
consideration for others) as well as Pixies (again a lot of energy and little consideration for others but more
light-hearted nature and, perhaps, less destructive consequences).

<h3>Humans</h3>
A human being should take care of his biophysical, psychological, intellectual and social/ethical dimensions altogether
- none of these can be neglected. Missions such as “4 Cardinal Virtues”, “7 Deadly Sins”, and “5D Explorer” can help a
person to hold on this plane of the reality. We assume also a person following these missions is likely to reincarnate
into the same human plane in the future.

<h3>Avatars</h3>
For those who are not content with a human plane, there is the realm of Avatars – mini-gods and other life-forms often
weaved into the half-baked conceptual constructs representing either fragments of a more comprehensive teaching or a
completely new design. They may exhibit positive, negative or neutral ethical values. They might be ephemeral and last
only short time, or they may stay, evolve and eventually underpin a comprehensive belief system. Superstitions fit
nicely into this realm. As an analogy think of a Petry dish – create a conceptual substrate, sprinkle it a few early
life-forms and see where it evolves.

<h3>Gods</h3>
The next after the Avatars is a spiritual domain, shaped up by a comprehensive, well established teachings typically
with a long record of history and thousands and millions of followers. This domain is rooted in dogmas of a particular
teaching which define the corresponding missions.

<h3>Beings</h3>
The realm of Beings is meant to transcend individual believes and provide a plane of the reality void of words and
matter and represented by a prior sustainable well-being, a light, an emanation, positive energy, radiance, nirvana or
something like that. It is a realm of a formless, material-less states of Being. To get in touch with this realm
you have to be in that same state of Being - calm, positive, fearless. There is no place for anger, envy,
anxiety, irritation etc.

<br<br>
    A table below summarises this mapping between missions, bundle dimensions, reality planes and manifestations. Once
    again, think of the bundle as a key opening a door into different realms, and missions providing means for reshaping
    this key to open one or another door.
    <br><br>
    Note that manifestations of the reality planes provide only a digital representation of the respective realms. They
    can
    help us to track the progress through the course of the mission, but, in general, they are secondary features
    referring
    to and complementing different planes of the reality (which are really real according to the ISO Machinery).
