<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2 id="bundleverse">1.1 Bundleverse</h2>
Bundleverse is a collection of Bundles.
<br>
<h2 id="bundle">1.2 Bundle </h2>
A Bundle is a collection of properties which define any item residing in Bundleverse. Remember a bundle definition of a
person – every individual is a collection of properties, such as, for example, physical, biological, social,
psychological, spiritual etcetera. Get rid of all these properties and the person is gone. Analogously, in Bundleverse
everything is a Bundle of properties.
<br><br>
A Bundle is a description of an item - an information, or a knowledge about it. Unlike any information in general (e.g.
a theory, a story, a novel), Bundles provide also instructions to follow in order to recover features characteristic of
the corresponding entities. In other words, Bundles have more in common with user-manuals rather than fiction-stories.
They tell us how to create, operate and maintain (or evolve) these entities.
<br><br>
Anyone in Bundleverse can design a new Bundle from scratch. Whether that new Bundle will underpin a new particular item 
(ie something really real, referred to as an instantiated bundle) or will
remains just an abstract theoretical construct, is to be seeing through practice. Instantiated Bundles reveal themselves
through various manifestations – an image, a function, a taste, a smell, experience etc. For many Bundles people are
hardwired with the right set of receptors to perceive these manifestations. In special cases the observer will
have to have a special training or education to be able to perceive that Bundle.

<br><br>
In general, Bundles can
represent anything, but in this document we will focus predominantly on Bundles 
representing people. Such Bundles are dynamic,
evolving entities. They define who we are but also provide a description of our idealised, better self (and also 
informs us how to get there). Some people want to change their diet, others may want to become smarter, 
happier, improve their emotional intelligence etc.  
To achieve these goals, we set some rules and instructions to follow. However, these rules and instructions
may not always work for us – i may want to become slimmer, but cannot refuse a slice of the cake, another person 
wants to wake up early, but sleeps in, our goals might be misleading, our passions and feelings may bend our reasons. 
<br><br>
To figure
out which strategies work best for us and what kind of goals we really want to pursue, we can iterate and refine them
through the succession of short-term missions. At the start of every new mission, we analyse outcomes from the previous
mission, and refine our goals and strategies to succeed in the next mission. After a number of iterations, we are likely
to have a better understanding of what we really want to achieve and how to get there.
Note that missions do not have to be focused exclusively on ourselves. The goal of the 
mission could be, for example, to improve the well-being of people we care about.
<br><br>


<h2 id="mission">1.5 Mission</h2>
A mission is a short-term iterative practice undertaken by user and aiming at altering his or her routine, 
day-to-day activities. The ultimate goal is either self-improvement or care for others.
<br><br>
Mission steps<br>
<ul>
<li>Design current and the desired future state of yourself.
</li><li>
Practice to transform current state into the desired future state.
</li><li>
Log and analyse outcomes of the practice.
</li><li>
Refine and iterate.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
Example of missions<br>
<i>Love My Mum</i> You promise smile to you mum, kiss her, and give her a hug, at least once a day amd then 
log the progress you make over the course of the mission.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker.</i> Grandpa complaining that changing weather is causing headaches. A bundle has weather APIs, 
and a radio-button for the grandpa to click on when he has a headache.
After several weeks you may have enough data to figure out if there is a correlation between weather and
headaches.
<br><br>

<i>Explorer.</i> The goal of the mission is to improve your physical fitness. A bundle has a number of properties, such as
weather, diet, physical activity, self-assessment. Some features are delivered automatically via api, other features
require your manual input. After several weeks you may start to see patterns and correlations. Refine and iterate.
<br><br>

Extended list of missions and their manifestations is available <a href="#appendixA"> here </a>. 
If you think these examples are not cool enough for you to get excited then help yourself - create your own mission 
from scratch as you feel it and see it (everything is in your hands). 
<br><br>
Missions belong to the category of self-help applications. For those with a transcendental bend 
an alternative unconventional interpretation of missions inspired by Storied Multiverse is outlined 
<a href="#appendixB"> here </a>.

Private data ownership<br>
Any time users can download their records collected in Bundleverse and then
delete the original copy on the server. Having these records downloaded and erased on a regular basis (e.g. after every
mission), makes sure that the remote server always holds only a minor fraction of the total records. Long-term records
belong to the user and they are kept safe on his or her local disks (perhaps, even disconnected from the internet).
It is up to the owner to either share this data with others (kids, friends, GP, whoever) or just 
keep it private for himself.

<h1 id="frontend">3. Frontend</h1>

<h2 id="registration">3.1 Registration</h2>
To register with a Bundle-pod, you can either join an established team or become a founder by setting up a new
Bundle-pod with a new team from scratch. The exact policy for joining an established team might vary from one team to
another (some teams letting anyone register online, others preferring a permissioned access). An alternative to joining
an established team is to set up your own Bundle-pod and build up your team there. You can have the 
Bundle-pod to be either provisioned for your by the cloud service provider or have it installed on your own  
server by yourself. Provisioning and maintaining your own server will require a certain level of IT expertise.
<br><br>

<h2 id="workflow">3.2 Workflow</h2>

Mission page. Upon a login the registered user lands on the missions page, which shows either the default mission or the
latest ran mission. You can select another mission from the “Missions” tab.<br>
Design page. Having a particular mission selected, the next step is to go to the “Design” page to create a bundle
template for that mission.<br>
Log page. Once you are happy with your bundle template, save it and go to the “Log” page to fill in your new bundle with
data.<br>
The “View” page is to visualise your mission data.<br>
The “Blog” is to record anything that does not fit into the bundle formal.<br>
The “Skybox” is a 3D environment for your team to cooperate (still work in progress).<br>
Note that the bundle template has to be designed only once, at the start of the mission. Having it established, next
time you log into the system, you go straight to the “Log” page to record new data.
<br><br>

<h2 id="mission2">3.3 Missions</h2>
Bundleverse provides a number of pre-built, default missions, readily available upon a registration. The user can also
create any number of his own customised missions or update prebuilt missions. To create a new mission, enter a new name
into the current mission table, and click on the “LAUNCH” button. To download data for this mission on your local
computer, click “DOWNLOAD” button. To delete this mission, click “DELETE” button. This will erase from the server all
data accumulated over the course of this mission. If you intend to keep this data on your local PC, make sure you
download this mission first before deleting it.
<br><br>

    <br>
    </center>
</div>


<h2 id="design">3.4 Design</h2>
To display a bundle template for the current mission, click on the “Design” button.<br>
To create a new bundle template for a new mission from scratch, click on the “Design” button. This will redirect you to
new page where you can build a new template using add, save, and delete buttons.<br>
A bundle template is a collection of tables. Each table represents a particular property (e.g physical, biological,
social etc). Each property table describes a collection of features assigned to that property (e.g. weight, exercise,
height considered physical features, a diet may belong to to table with biological properties etc.)
<br><br>
Note that saving a new bundle-template deletes all the earlier records and starts this mission again.

Every feature in the template table is represented by 8 cells:<br>
Feature, units, min, max, target, type, apiFile, and longName.
<ol> 
<li>    
Feature cell shows a feature name (must be alphanumeric)
</li><li>
Units must not exceed 10 characters
</li><li>
Min is the minimum value of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 0 for a radio button.
</li><li>
Max is the maxim values of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 1 for the radio button.
</li><li>
Target is the desired target value to be achieved during the mission (must lie within the min-max range).
</li><li>
Type is either “text”, “radio” or “api”.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>
       “text” is a default type and indicates input text area
    </li><li>
       “radio” is for a checkbox, and
    </li><li>
       “api” is for an api input (to be provisioned by the admin)
    </li>
    </ol>

</li><li>
apiFile – is a name of the json file holding api data (admin access only). The data are to be generated by api script
(to be written by admin, and called regularly to get new data).
</li><li>
longName is the name of the feature as shown in the api json file (admin access only).
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="log">3.5 Log</h2>
The “Log” page is where you enter your data on a regular basis over the course of the
mission.
<br><br>

Some of these fields will be filled by api. Others will require your manual input.<br>
“SAVE” button lets you to accumulate your records over the course of the day (or several days) and then submit all these
data at once by clicking “SUBMIT” button.

<h2 id="view">3.6 View</h2>
The View page shows a spider-plot (you need to save the Log data first in order to view this plot).
Radar-plot. For every feature in you log tables, the spider-plot shows the target value (red), the latest recorded value
(blue) and the mean value over the course of the mission (yellow). All values are normalised to vary from 0 to 100%,
corresponding to min and max values, respectively, as indicated in the design tables.
The navigation circle in the top-right is to switch between targets, last records, and mean values on the spider-plot.

<h1 id="appendixA">AppendixA: Missions and manifestations</h1>
<br><br>
Bundleverse provides a number of prebuilt missions and manifestations, readily available upon a registration. Each
mission can be customised to the requirements of a particular user. Manifestations are attached to missions and provide
a visual representation of the mission. They also help track the progress achieved over the course of the mission. This
section gives a short overview of these prebuilt missions and manifestations.
<br><br>

<h3>Missions></h3>
<br><br>

<i>Love My Mum</i>
This is a very simple mission – you promise to kiss, hug, and smile to your mum every day.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker</i>
The Tracker is based on weather APIs, so that you can log your own state and see if it has anything to do with the
changing weather.
<br><br>

<i>Cardinal Virtues</i>
Historically cardinal virtues included temperance, fortitude, justice and prudence. Later spiritual virtues have been
added to this list (hope, humility, faith).
<br><br>

<i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>
Seven deadly sins traditionally refer to 1. Lust 2. Gluttony 3. Greed. 4. Sloth 5. Wrath 6. Envy 7. Pride. As you can
see there is no direct correspondence between deadly sins and cardinal virtues.
<br><br>

<i>8-fold path</i>
Not implemented yet.
<br><br>

<i>Positive psychology</i>
Not implemented yet.
<br><br>

<i>Explorer</i>
Explorer is a master mission which can be easily reshaped to get other missions. It has been designed to reflect major
dimensions of a human being (and of course you can custonise it to your own perception of these major dimensions).
Tables selected so far include 1. Environmental (weather) 2. Biophysical 3. Psychological (Emotional) 4. Intellectual 5.
Social (Ethical) 6. Spiritual 7 Transcendental dimensions.
The first Environmental dimension includes prebuild weather APIs. Biophysical, Psychological, Intellectual and Social
dimensions roughly correspond to 4 cardinal virtues (Temperance, Fortitude, Wisdom, and Justice).
<br><br>


<i> Sizmarian personality</i>
The goal of the mission is to design and instantiate a new personality from scratch
(let’s call it sizmarian after the Georgian sizmari – dream).
The description of the sizmarian person must outline features characteristic of this personality 
and also include the description of practices specific to sizmarians. 
Note that we don’t
have to flesh out all the details of this personality upfront but instead we can start by making a draft 
outline (see dot points below), and then run 
it through the cycles of missions refining after each iteration.
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>
        Characteristic of sizmarians is some special state of Being (e.g. being cool, positive, caring, generous
        etcetera).
        This state of Being transcends all other features of sizmarians and makes them resistant to dogmatic teachings -
        sizmarians respect beliefs by others but when it comes to their own theories they take them easy, often with a
        touch of an irony.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians design and maintain their own afterlife (don’t know exactly how – be creative).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians run projects to make this world a better place (e.g. eradicate poverty, promote education, advance
        science, fight injustice etc).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians build and maintain digital twins of themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a sizmarian life is great - it is always bright and full of exciting surprises. Make no mistake here,
        sizmarians are
        aware of the suffering and misery permeating this world, but they also believe the broken parts 
        can be fixed.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Manifestations</h3>
Mission manifestations established so far include Cube, Golem, Garden, Desert, Buddha. Still missing are Dragon, Person,
Avatar.



<br><br>
<h1 id="appendixB">AppendixB: Planes of the Reality</h1>
<br><br>

Missions and manifestations offered by Bundleverse seem to make up a fairly random collection of items often unrelated
to each other. To make sense out of this collection, let me introduce a mental construct, a story overarching these
missions and manifestations and, hopefully, making them easier to comprehend and use.
<br><br>

First of all I’m going to instantiate a number of different planes of the reality through the Bundleverse 
(planes of the reality ... hm?). To handle such a weird project 
I’ll take onboard the perspective of <a href="https://storiedmultiverse.github.io/"> Storied Multiverse. </a> 
According to Storied Multiverse, anything that have ever existed in the past 
or will exist in the future in this or any other possible world, has been designed, instantiated, and maintained 
by a human kind through the Instantiated Storied Object Machinery (ISOM).  
According to ISOM, to create a new entity one has to provide a
more or less coherent description of that entity, including the description of features characteristic of it, and also
define reproducible practices delivering these features. Having all these ingredients cooked up, one can run 
these practices and instantiate that entity.
<br><br>

Following this schema, I’m introducing several realms (called also reality planes) - 
Environmental, Rocks and Plants, Animals, Humans, Avatars,
Gods, and the realm of Beings. Most of these reality planes are ordered into a hierarchy - 
every next level of the reality extends
the previous one except the top level of Beings which is meant to be a special realm outside the space of rules and 
logic. Another special realm, the bottom one, called Environmental, is an umbrella term referring to a 
bunch of different realms 
(e.g. Natural, Financial,Political, Ethnical, Professional).
Unlike other realms (often having some kind of a life-form weaved in) environmental planes of the reality are made out of
life-less forms. 
<br><br>

Each plane of the reality is characterised with special states-of-being which define these planes. 
People can either fully experience these states-of-being or have some glimpses of them by going through 
special practices (called missions). 
Environmental realms again stand out, since practices for these realms
are often designed and implemented through special sciences.
<br><br>

Life-forms weaved into the planes of the reality have a secondary, assistive role. They represent states-of-being 
associated with these plane and help us to describe and understand these states. 
<br><br>

The term "state-of-being" could be referring to various configurations and superpositions of the mental, 
psychological, spiritual, aesthetic, ethical states which we can experience to various degrees under 
certain conditions. Those conditions  could be associated with 
people excelling in sports, music, science, art, overcoming 
difficulties and achieving goals, exhibiting virtuous behavior, playing and enjoying games, maditating,
playing etcetera.     
At the higher planes of the reality these states-of-being may have
nothing to do with someone's thinking, desiring, or feeling. They could be referring, for example,
to some abstract state of a positive,
calm, existential radiance which belongs to higher planes and may or may not fit exactly into the 
realm of humans.
<br><br>

To flesh out the structure of the connections between people and these planes of the reality 
(and explain the process of the instantiation), I’ll assume a bundle
representation of a person as a collection of environmental, biophysical, psychological, intellectual, social, spiritual
and transcendental dimensions. Furthermore, I’ll postulate also a mapping from this bundle of personality to 
various planes of the reality (see table below). This mapping builds on an assumption that our actions, 
thoughts, feelings, sentiments accumulated
through time (and integrated into an overarching conceptual framework) connect us to various planes of the reality (a
venerated idea exploited by many teachings). These connections are established through the personality bundle and by
purposefully changing the shape of that bundle (for example, through the development of individual character traits 
associated with the dimensions of that bundle) one can change the strength (or weights) of these connections. 
In other words, people of different characters connect to different realms
and they can changes these connections by by changing their character.
<br><br>

Since reality plains combine into hierarchical structures, instantiating the top level realm implies 
instantiation of the nested realms too. Hence, instead of being connected to a single plane, people connect to
a range of planes. The strength of such connections varies across these planes.    
<br><br>

Strong connection to a particular realm implies a tendency for a
person to behave, think, feel, and perceive surrounding world in a way consistent with that realm. 
In terms of the ISOM vocabulary, we say we have delivered features characteristic of the particular realm
(i.e. we have instantiated it), when we experience states-of-being characteristic of that realm. 
<br><br>

The reader might be wondering at this point why we need these reality planes anyway? They are defined in terms of  
 states-of-being a person can experience over the course of his lifetime. What is the point of introducing those
 extra entities? 
<br><br>

The point of having these reality planes is that now we have a placeholder for states-of-beings 
independent of our material or bodily manifestations. With this infrastructure in place, we can
push our story-line further and assume that a person can reincarnate into another realm in the future 
when he is gone from the realm of humans. 
In other words, we assume that people can transform into an idealistic immaterial state-of-being 
allocated somewhere else outside their body. 
If this state-of-being has a strong association with 
the human or higher planes of the reality, then that person reincarnates to the current plane 
or moves up to higher planes, otherwise he goes down. 
Hence, the  point to take home- take care of yourself.
<br><br>

Can we prove these planes of the reality are really real?
<br><br>
Well... it depends, of course, on how we define the term "really real" and what counts as a sufficient proof,
but, in general, in most cases the short answer to this question, I think, will be that we cannot. 
Furthermore, if we live in a single material world, it 
does not make sense to suggest that such planes exist at all. 
On the other hand, if we take a Storied Multiverse perspective (teemed with various kinds of instantiated objects),
then it makes perfect sense to suggest that these realms either already exist or, if they don't, 
they can be instantiated in the future. According to this multiverse vision, the reality of these planes is 
a plausible hypothesis. Now don't be confused here, we still cannot prove them 100%, but 
given the complexity of the subject matter we shall never expect a clear cut, unequivocal answers here. 
Having a framework where these realms become plausible entities is already a 
great achievement which can trigger a huge difference in the way we perceive and handle these realms.
Another point to make here is that regardless existential status of these realms we don't need 
anyone's permission or approval to play with them. Fiction worlds could be as much entertaining  
as the real ones, or even more. Having said this, the hypothesis of the reality of these planes, 
i believe, sets the whole game on a qualitatively new level. If it is true then by running missions 
we might be instantiating the whole new planes of the reality (or maintaining the established ones).    
<br><br>

The list of the realms presented here
is not immutable. You can design your own realm and then instantiate and maintain it through your own missions (if you
wish so). Note that by following conventions and taking for granted a certain description of the self and the universe,
we are already participating in this game and are connected to certain realms.  
Connection to a new realm implies the disconnection from the original one.
<br><br>

Let’s run a few examples to illustrate the relationship between these reality planes, their manifestations, dimensions of
personality, and missions (see table below).
<br><br>

<h3>Environmental</h3>
Let’s start with the planes of the reality populated with non-living forms (ie natural, financial, political,
professional, ethnical domains). Each of these planes has a counterpart in the personality bundle (called collectively
as environmental dimension). Having all other aspects of personality (apart from the environmental) neglected,
transforms a person into a passive entity, conditioned by these external environmental factors. Like a formless dust he
will need a vessel to maintain his shape. Without such vessel he turns into a formless pile of dirt with no meaning and
no purpose. On the other hand, if the environmental dimensions of personality are neglected and all other dimensions are
looked after, you may end up with a poor, blind saint bumping into the walls of the unknown and not being able to look
even after himself, let alone to help others. Environmental planes today are increasingly handled by special sciences,
but general public can also partake in maintaining these realms by monitoring/observing, learning, and working with
them.

<h3>Rocks and Plants</h3>
The realm of Rocks and Plants is associated with the physical and biological dimensions of a person and is populated
with a low-level life forms such as Golems and Groots . To instantiate and maintain this realm, one takes care of his
bodily health, power, appearance. If all other dimensions of personality are neglected, such person transforms into a
Golem or Groot. On the other hand, if he does not care about his body at all, he gets sick and dies.

<h3>Animals</h3>
Having advanced both biophysical and psychological dimensions of personality but lacking social dimension projects a
person into the realm of animals. You can meet here Dragons (psychotic personalities with a lot of energy but little
consideration for others) as well as Pixies (again a lot of energy and little consideration for others but more
light-hearted nature and, perhaps, less destructive consequences).

<h3>Humans</h3>
A human being should take care of his biophysical, psychological, intellectual and social/ethical dimensions altogether
- none of these can be neglected. Missions such as “4 Cardinal Virtues”, “7 Deadly Sins”, and “5D Explorer” can help a
person to hold on this plane of the reality. We assume also a person following these missions is likely to reincarnate
into the same human plane in the future.

<h3>Avatars</h3>
For those who are not content with a human plane, there is the realm of Avatars – mini-gods and other life-forms often
weaved into the half-baked conceptual constructs representing either fragments of a more comprehensive teaching or a
completely new design. They may exhibit positive, negative or neutral ethical values. They might be ephemeral and last
only short time, or they may stay, evolve and eventually underpin a comprehensive belief system. Superstitions fit
nicely into this realm. As an analogy think of a Petry dish – create a conceptual substrate, sprinkle it a few early
life-forms and see where it evolves.

<h3>Gods</h3>
The next after the Avatars is a spiritual domain, shaped up by a comprehensive, well established teachings typically
with a long record of history and thousands and millions of followers. This domain is rooted in dogmas of a particular
teaching which define the corresponding missions.

<h3>Beings</h3>
The realm of Beings is meant to transcend individual believes and provide a plane of the reality void of words and
matter and represented by a prior sustainable well-being, a light, an emanation, positive energy, radiance, nirvana or
something like that. It is a realm of a formless, material-less states of Being. To get in touch with this realm
you have to be in that same state of Being - calm, positive, fearless. There is no place for anger, envy,
anxiety, irritation etc.  

<br<br>
A table below summarises this mapping between missions, bundle dimensions, reality planes and manifestations. Once
again, think of the bundle as a key opening a door into different realms, and missions providing means for reshaping
this key to open one or another door.
<br><br>
Note that manifestations of the reality planes provide only a digital representation of the respective realms. They can
help us to track the progress through the course of the mission, but, in general, they are secondary features referring
to and complementing different planes of the reality (which are really real according to the ISO Machinery).
