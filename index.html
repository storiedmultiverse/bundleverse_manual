<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2 id="bundleverse">1.1 Bundleverse</h2>
Bundleverse is a collection of Bundles.
<br>
<h2 id="bundle">1.2 Bundle </h2>
A Bundle is a collection of properties which define any item residing in Bundleverse. Remember a bundle definition of a
person – every individual is a collection of properties, such as, for example, physical, biological, social,
psychological, spiritual etcetera. Get rid of all these properties and the person is gone. Analogously, in Bundleverse
everything is a Bundle of properties.
<br><br>

A Bundle is a description of an item - an information, or a knowledge about it. Unlike any information in general (e.g.
a theory, a story, a novel), the Bundle provides also instructions to follow in order to recover features characteristic of
the corresponding entity. In other words, Bundles have more in common with user-manuals rather than fiction-stories.
They tell us how to create, operate and maintain (or evolve) something.
<br><br>

Anyone in Bundleverse can design a new Bundle from scratch. Whether that new Bundle will underpin a new particular item 
(ie something really real, referred to as an instantiated Bundle) or will
remains just an abstract theoretical construct, is to be seeing through practice. Instantiated Bundles reveal themselves
through various manifestations – an image, a function, a taste, a smell, experience etc. For many Bundles people are
hardwired with the right set of receptors to perceive these manifestations. In special cases the observer will
have to have a special training or education to be able to perceive that Bundle.

<br><br>
In general, Bundles can
represent anything, but in this document we will focus predominantly on Bundles 
representing people. Such Bundles are dynamic,
evolving entities. They define who we are but also provide a description of our idealised, better self (and also 
inform us how to get there).   
To become a better person, we design some rules and  instructions to follow. However, these rules and instructions
may not always work for us – i want to have a slimmer body, but cannot refuse a slice of the cake, someone 
wants to wake up early, but sleeps in, our goals could be misleading, our passions and feelings may bend our reasons. 
<br><br>
To figure
out which strategies work best for us and what kind of goals we really want to achieve, we can iterate and refine them
through the succession of short-term missions. At the start of every mission, we analyse outcomes from the previous
mission, and refine our goals and strategies to succeed in the next mission. After a number of iterations, we are likely
to have a better understanding of what we really want to achieve and how to get there.
Note that missions do not have to be focused exclusively on ourselves. The goal of the 
mission could be, for example, the well-being of people we care about.
<br><br>


<h2 id="mission">1.5 Mission</h2>
A mission is a short-term iterative practice aiming at altering our routine, 
day-to-day activities. The ultimate goal is either self-improvement or care for others.
<br><br>
Mission steps<br>
<ul>
<li>Describe yourself as you are right now and then design the desired future state of yourself.
</li><li>
Practice to transform current state into the desired future state.
</li><li>
Log and analyse outcomes of the practice.
</li><li>
Refine and iterate.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
Example of missions<br>
<i>Love My Mum</i> You promise smile to you mum, kiss her, and give her a hug, at least once a day and then 
log the progress you make over the course of the mission. 
<br><br>

<i>Tracker.</i> Grandpa complaining that changing weather is causing him to have headaches. A Bundle has weather APIs, 
and a radio-button for the grandpa to click on when a headache is on.
After several weeks you may have enough data to figure out if there is a correlation between changing weather and
headaches.
<br><br>

<i>Explorer.</i> The goal of this mission is to better understand your Self. A Bundle is made out of the
environmental, bio-physical, psychological, and other dimensions. Some of these are delivered 
automatically via api, other dimensions
require your manual input. After several weeks you may start seeing patterns and correlations. Refine and iterate.
<br><br>

Extended list of missions and their manifestations is available <a href="#appendixA"> here </a>. 
If you think these missions are not good enough for you, feel free to create your own mission 
from scratch. 
<br><br>

Missions belong to the category of self-help applications. For those with a transcendental bent of mind 
an alternative, unconventional interpretation of missions (inspired by Storied Multiverse) is outlined 
<a href="#appendixB"> here </a>.

Private data ownership<br>
Any time users can download their records collected in Bundleverse and then
delete the original copy on the server. Having these records downloaded and erased on a regular basis (e.g. after every
mission), ensures that the remote server always holds only a minor fraction of the total records. 
Long-term records belong to the user and they are kept safe on his or her local disks. 
It is up to the owner of the data to either share this data with others 
(kids, friends, GP, whoever) or just keep it private for himself.
<br><br>

 
<h1 id="frontend">3. Frontend</h1>

<h2 id="registration">3.1 Registration</h2>
To design and run missions, you have to register with Bundleverse 
<a href="https:/bundleverse.com">https:/bundleverse.com</a>
<br><br>

<h2 id="workflow">3.2 Workflow</h2>
<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="Navbar.png" alt="navbar">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>

Mission page. Login and select a mission from the “Missions” tab.<br>
Design page. Having a particular mission selected, go to the “Design” page to create a Bundle
template for that mission.<br>
Log page. Once you are happy with your Bundle template, save it and go to the “Log” page to fill in this new Bundle with
data.<br>
The “View” page is to visualise and better understand your data.<br>
The “Blog” is to record anything that does not fit into the Bundle format.<br>
The “Skybox” is a 3D environment to manifest your progress through the mission. 
Every time you log your data, a new feature is added to the Skybox until it reaches a saturation point. 
To maintain the Skybox at the saturation point, you have to keep logging your at least data once per day 
(otherwise, the Skybox  degrades to its original state, with no extra features). <br>
<br><br>

Note, however exciting these Skybox manifestations, they are just representations of something you are 
building in real life. Manifestations may change, but the entity you are instantiating and 
maintaining through the mission stays, it is real. 

<br><br>

<h2 id="mission2">3.3 Missions</h2>
Bundleverse provides a number of pre-built, default missions, readily available upon a registration. The user can also
create his own customised mission or update prebuilt missions. To create a new mission, enter a new name
into the current mission table, and click on the “LAUNCH” button. 
<br><br>

To download data for this mission on your local computer, click “DOWNLOAD” button. This will download a zip file
to your machine. The key file with your data is ASCI file "Features.ts". The data is organised in columns with headers. 
The first column is time, the rest is features of your Bundle. Visualise it, feed it to Neural Network, 
do whatever you like.

<br><br> 
To delete this mission, click “DELETE” button. This will erase from the server all
data accumulated over the course of this mission. If you intend to keep this data on your local PC, make sure you
download this mission first before deleting it.
<br><br>

By default a mission is private (as indicated in the bottom right corner of the mission table). 
In a private mission you are the only person responsible for the progress made through this mission.
This progress is shown in the mission table. It is also illustrated qualitatively through the manifestation 
of this mission in the Skybox. For example, if Jane and Bob run private missions both represented in a Skybox 
by a "cube",
their progress through these missions is independent from each other (even if the missions have the same titles). 
In the Jane's Skybox the cube could be  immobilized on the ground, while in Bob's Skybox the cube could be 
spinning well above the ground.

<br><br>
For a shared mission, you still own your data, but other people can contribute to the progress you make through 
the mission. For example, if Bob sets the mission to be shared, and Jan then joins this mission 
(by launching a shared  mission with the same title), then Bob and Jain join their forces.
Every time Jane logs to this mission, points are added to Bob's mission too (by incrementing his progress).
And vice verse, every time Bob logs to the mission, both his and Jane's progress is incremented.  
In a shared mission, when Bob and  Jane log to the Skybox, they both share the same manifestation in the Skybox 
(e.g. same "cube"). But the data, again,
remain private - Jane owns here data, and Bon owns his own records. Only the indicators of progress are shared.

<br><br>
The key idea behind these shared missions, is to highlight our ability to create and maintain the whole range 
of objects through our collective efforts. We can design something exciting and new, 
something that have never existed before, and then instantiate and maintain it together. We can make it real.

</div>


<h2 id="design">3.4 Design</h2>
To display a Bundle for the current mission, go to the “Design” page.<br>
To create a new Bundle for a new mission from scratch, again, go to the “Design” page. <br>
A Bundle is a collection of tables. Each table represents a particular property (e.g physical, biological,
social etc). Each table describes a collection of features assigned to that property (e.g. weight, diet, 
exercise etc.)
<br><br>
Note that saving a new bundle-template deletes all the earlier records and starts this mission again.
<br><br>

        <img src="design.png" alt="Design">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>


Every table has a title, space for comments, and feature fields.  
Every feature in the table is represented by 8 cells:<br>
Feature, units, min, max, target, type, apiFile, and longName.
<ol> 
<li>    
Feature cell shows a feature name (must be alphanumeric)
</li><li>
Units must not exceed 10 characters
</li><li>
Min is the minimum value of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 0 for a radio button.
</li><li>
Max is the maxim values of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 1 for the radio button.
</li><li>
Target is the desired target value to be achieved during the mission (must lie within the min-max range).
</li><li>
Type is either “text”, “radio” or “api”.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>
       “text” is a default type and indicates input text area
    </li><li>
       “radio” is for a checkbox, and
    </li><li>
       “api” is for an api input (to be provisioned by the admin)
    </li>
    </ol>

</li><li>
apiFile – is a name of the json file holding api data (admin access only). The data are to be generated by api script
(to be written by admin, and called regularly to get new data).
</li><li>
longName is the name of the feature as shown in the api json file (admin access only).
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="log">3.5 Log</h2>
The “Log” page is where you enter your data on a regular basis over the course of the mission.
<br><br>

Some of these fields will be filled by api. Others will require your manual input.<br>
“SAVE” button lets you to accumulate your records over the course of the day (or several days) and then submit all these
data at once by clicking “SUBMIT” button.

<br><br>


<h2 id="view">3.6 View</h2>
The View page shows a spider-plot summary of your records 
(you need to save the Log data first in order to view this plot).
Red color shows your targets, blue is the latest recorded value
and yellow is the mean value over the course of the mission. All values are normalised to vary from 0 to 100%,
corresponding to min and max values, respectively, as indicated in the design tables.
The navigation circle in the top-right is to switch between targets, last records, and mean values on the spider-plot.

Private data ownership<br>
Any time users can download records collected on a Bundle-pod and then
delete the original copy on the server. Having these records downloaded and erased on a regular basis (e.g. after every
mission), makes sure that the remote server always holds only a minor fraction of the total records. Long-term records
belong to the user and they are kept safe on his or her local disks (perhaps, even disconnected from the network).
It is up to the user to share this data with kids, friends, GP, whoever (or just keep it private for himself).

<h1 id="appendixA">AppendixA: Missions and manifestations</h1>
<br><br>
Bundleverse provides a number of prebuilt missions and manifestations, readily available upon a registration. Each
of these missions can be customised further to fit requirements of a particular user. 
Manifestations are attached to these missions and provide
a visual representation of these missions. They also help us to track the progress achieved over the course of the mission. 
This section gives a short overview of these prebuilt missions and manifestations.
<br><br>

<h3>Missions></h3>
<br><br>

<i>Love My Mum</i>
This is a very simple mission – you promise to kiss, hug, and smile to your mum every day.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker</i>
The Tracker is based on weather APIs, so that you can log your own state (health indicators) 
and see if it has anything to do with the
changing weather. Beware, the weather API may not be particularly accurate at your location. 
If the uncertainty is too high, enter weather data for your location manually. 
<br><br>

<i>Cardinal Virtues</i>
Historically cardinal virtues included temperance, fortitude, justice and prudence. Later spiritual virtues have been
added to this list (hope, humility, faith). Be creative, write up your own list of virtues if you feel so.
<br><br>

<i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>
Seven deadly sins traditionally refer to 1. Lust 2. Gluttony 3. Greed. 4. Sloth 5. Wrath 6. Envy 7. Pride. As you can
see there is no direct correspondence between deadly sins and cardinal virtues. You may allocate one day a week to 
deal with  each of these items separately.
<br><br>

<i>8-fold path</i>
Eight-fold path is about Buddhist path to perfection. The content clearly can be refined and extended. 
Feel free to improve. 
<br><br>

<i>Positive psychology</i>
Based on a science study by Seligman and Peterson (ref ...). 
<br><br>

<i>Explorer</i>
Explorer is meant to be a master mission which is can be easily reshaped to transform into any other mission. 
It has been designed to reflect major dimensions of the human nature (feel free to customise it to your own 
perception of the human nature).
Properties selected so far comprise 1. Environmental (weather) 2. Biophysical 
3. Psychological (Emotional) 4. Intellectual 5. Social (Ethical) 6. Spiritual and 
7. Transcendental dimensions.
<br>
The Environmental dimension builds on weather APIs. Biophysical, Psychological, Intellectual and Social
dimensions roughly correspond to 4 cardinal virtues (Temperance, Fortitude, Wisdom, and Justice).
<br><br>


<i> Sizmarian personality</i>
The goal of this mission is to design and instantiate a new personality from scratch
(called sizmarian after the Georgian sizmari – dream).
The description of the sizmarian person must outline features characteristic of this personality 
and also describe practices specific to sizmarians. 
Note that we don’t
have to flesh out all the details of this personality upfront but instead we can start by making a draft 
outline (see dot points below), and then running 
it through the cycles of missions refining after each iteration.
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>
        Characteristic of sizmarians is some special state of Being (e.g. being cool, positive, caring, generous, 
        a member of the community etcetera).
        This state of Being transcends all other features defining sizmarians, 
        making them resistant to dogmatic teachings -
        sizmarians respect beliefs by others but when it comes to their own theories they take them easy, often with a
        touch of an irony.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians design and maintain their own afterlife (don’t know exactly how – be creative).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians run projects to make this world a better place (e.g. eradicate poverty, promote education, advance
        science, fight injustice etc).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians build and maintain digital twins of themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a sizmarian life is good - it is always bright and full of exciting surprises. Make no mistake here,
        sizmarians are
        aware of the suffering and misery permeating this world, but they also believe the broken parts 
        eventually can be fixed.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Manifestations</h3>
Mission manifestations established so far include 'cube', 'city', 'golem', 'mermaid', 'butterfly', 'buddha'. 

<br><br>
<h1 id="appendixB">AppendixB: Interpretations</h1>
<br><br>

Missions can be interpreted in a number of ways. For example, they can be considered a passive monitoring tool - 
we observe weather and log our health indicators to derive certain  conclusions from this data. 
An alternative interpretation of a mission, is a device helping us to 
populate this world with a fundamentally new entities created and maintained through missions.
Let me explain this point.   

<br><br>

First of all, i shall take onboard the perspective of <a href="https://storiedmultiverse.github.io/"> Storied Multiverse. </a> 
According to Storied Multiverse, any item in 
in this world (or any other possible world), has been designed, instantiated, and maintained 
by a human kind through the Instantiated Storied Object Machinery (ISOM).  
According to ISOM, to create a new entity, one has to provide a
more or less coherent description of that entity, including the description of features characteristic of it, and also
define reproducible practices delivering these features. Having all these ingredients cooked up, one runs 
these practices to instantiate that entity. If features characteristic of that entity, are indeed delivered reliably,
through reproducible practices then whatever the description, it must be referring to the real entity. 
<br><br>

This schema applies to almost anything. The key point is to have a plausible description of something, 
and an outline of practices promising to deliver features  characteristic of that something. These promises are then
tested through practices which either instantiate  that entity (thus proving it real), or vice versa,
fail to instantiate it (thus proving it to be an abstract, hypothetical construct).   
<br><br>

Bundleverse provides an infrastructure particularly suitable for implementing this schema. 
The structure of Bundles is flexible enough to accommodate a relatively comprehensive description of almost any entity. 
Targets, specified through the Bundle, define and chanel practices. Finally, the logging 
mechanism facilitates implementation of these practices and evaluation of their outcomes.
