<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2 id="bundleverse">1.1 Bundleverse</h2>
Bundleverse is a collection of Bundles.
<br>
<h2 id="bundle">1.2 Bundle </h2>
A Bundle is a collection of properties which define any item residing in Bundleverse. Remember a bundle definition of a
person – every individual is a collection of properties, such as, for example, physical, biological, social,
psychological, spiritual etcetera. Get rid of all these properties and the person is gone. Analogously, in Bundleverse
everything is a Bundle of properties.
<br><br>
A Bundle is a description of an item - an information, or a knowledge about it. Unlike any information in general (e.g.
a theory, a story, a novel), Bundles provide also instructions to follow in order to recover features characteristic of
the corresponding entities. In other words, Bundles have more in common with user-manuals rather than fiction-stories.
They tell us how to create, operate and maintain (or evolve) these entities.
<br><br>
Anyone in Bundleverse can design a new Bundle from scratch. Whether that new Bundle will underpin a new particular item 
(ie something really real, referred to as an instantiated bundle) or will
remains just an abstract theoretical construct, is to be seeing through practice. Instantiated Bundles reveal themselves
through various manifestations – an image, a function, a taste, a smell, experience etc. For many Bundles people are
hardwired with the right set of receptors to perceive these manifestations. In special cases the observer will
have to have a special training or education to be able to perceive that Bundle.

<br><br>
In general, Bundles can
represent anything, but in this document we will focus predominantly on Bundles 
representing people. Such Bundles are dynamic,
evolving entities. They define who we are but also provide a description of our idealised, better self (and also 
informs us how to get there). Some people want to change their diet, others may want to become smarter, 
happier, improve their emotional intelligence etc.  
To achieve these goals, we set some rules and instructions to follow. However, these rules and instructions
may not always work for us – i want to become slimmer, but cannot refuse a slice of the cake, another person 
wants to wake up early, but sleeps in, our goals might be misleading, our passions and feelings may bend our reasons. 
<br><br>
To figure
out which strategies work best for us and what kind of goals we really want to pursue, we can iterate and refine them
through the succession of short-term missions. At the start of every new mission, we analyse outcomes from the previous
mission, and refine our goals and strategies to succeed in the next mission. After a number of iterations, we are likely
to have a better understanding of what we really want to achieve and how to get there.
Note that missions do not have to be focused exclusively on ourselves. The goal of the 
mission could be, for example, the well-being of people we care about.
<br><br>


<h2 id="mission">1.5 Mission</h2>
A mission is a short-term iterative practice and aiming at altering our routine, 
day-to-day activities. The ultimate goal is either self-improvement or care for others.
<br><br>
Mission steps<br>
<ul>
<li>Describe yourself as you are right now and then design the desired future state of yourself.
</li><li>
Practice to transform current state into the desired future state.
</li><li>
Log and analyse outcomes of the practice.
</li><li>
Refine and iterate.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
Example of missions<br>
<i>Love My Mum</i> You promise smile to you mum, kiss her, and give her a hug, at least once a day and then 
log the progress you make over the course of the mission. If your mum is not with you, adjust appropriately.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker.</i> Grandpa complaining that changing weather is causing him to have headaches. A bundle has weather APIs, 
and a radio-button for the grandpa to click on when a headache is on.
After several weeks you may have enough data to figure out if there is a correlation between weather and
headaches.
<br><br>

<i>Explorer.</i> The goal of the mission is to better understand your Selfs. A bundle has a number of properties, such as
environmental, bio-physical, psychological, self-assessment etc. Some features are delivered automatically via api, other features
require your manual input. After several weeks you may start to see patterns and correlations. Refine and iterate.
<br><br>

Extended list of missions and their manifestations is available <a href="#appendixA"> here </a>. 
If you think these examples are not good enough for you, create your own mission 
from scratch as you feel it and see it (everything is in your hands). 
<br><br>
Missions belong to the category of self-help applications. For those with a transcendental bent of mind 
an alternative, unconventional interpretation of missions (inspired by Storied Multiverse) is outlined 
<a href="#appendixB"> here </a>.

Private data ownership<br>
Any time users can download their records collected in Bundleverse and then
delete the original copy on the server. Having these records downloaded and erased on a regular basis (e.g. after every
mission), ensures that the remote server always holds only a minor fraction of the total records. 
Long-term records belong to the user and they are kept safe on his or her local disks. 
It is up to the owner of the data to either share this data with others 
(kids, friends, GP, whoever) or just keep it private for himself.

<h1 id="frontend">3. Frontend</h1>

<h2 id="registration">3.1 Registration</h2>
To design and run missions, you have to register with Bundleverse 
<a href="https:/bundleverse.com">https:/bundleverse.com</a>
<br><br>

<h2 id="workflow">3.2 Workflow</h2>
<div class="w3-main">

        <br>
        <img src="Navbar.png" alt="navbar">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>

Mission page. Login and select a mission from the “Missions” tab.<br>
Design page. Having a particular mission selected, the next step is to go to the “Design” page to create a bundle
template for that mission.<br>
Log page. Once you are happy with your bundle template, save it and go to the “Log” page to fill in this new bundle with
data.<br>
The “View” page is to visualise your mission data.<br>
The “Blog” is to record anything that does not fit into the bundle formal.<br>
The “Skybox” is a 3D environment to manifest your progress.<br>
Note that the bundle template has to be designed only once, at the start of the mission. Having it established, next
time you log into the system, you go straight to the “Log” page to record new data.
<br><br>

<h2 id="mission2">3.3 Missions</h2>
Bundleverse provides a number of pre-built, default missions, readily available upon a registration. The user can also
create his own customised missions or update prebuilt missions. To create a new mission, enter a new name
into the current mission table, and click on the “LAUNCH” button. <br>
To download data for this mission on your local
computer, click “DOWNLOAD” button.<br> 
To delete this mission, click “DELETE” button. This will erase from the server all
data accumulated over the course of this mission. If you intend to keep this data on your local PC, make sure you
download this mission first before deleting it.
<br><br>

<div class="w3-main">

    <br>
    </center>
</div>


<h2 id="design">3.4 Design</h2>
To display a bundle for the current mission, go to the “Design” page.<br>
To create a new bundle for a new mission from scratch, go to the “Design” page. <br>
A bundle is a collection of tables. Each table represents a particular property (e.g physical, biological,
social etc). Each property table describes a collection of features assigned to that property (e.g. weight, diet, 
exercise etc.)
<br><br>
Note that saving a new bundle-template deletes all the earlier records and starts this mission again.
<br><br>

<div class="w3-main">

        <br>
        <img src="design.png" alt="Design">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>


Every table has a title, space for comments, and feature fields.  
Every feature in the table is represented by 8 cells:<br>
Feature, units, min, max, target, type, apiFile, and longName.
<ol> 
<li>    
Feature cell shows a feature name (must be alphanumeric)
</li><li>
Units must not exceed 10 characters
</li><li>
Min is the minimum value of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 0 for a radio button.
</li><li>
Max is the maxim values of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 1 for the radio button.
</li><li>
Target is the desired target value to be achieved during the mission (must lie within the min-max range).
</li><li>
Type is either “text”, “radio” or “api”.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>
       “text” is a default type and indicates input text area
    </li><li>
       “radio” is for a checkbox, and
    </li><li>
       “api” is for an api input (to be provisioned by the admin)
    </li>
    </ol>

</li><li>
apiFile – is a name of the json file holding api data (admin access only). The data are to be generated by api script
(to be written by admin, and called regularly to get new data).
</li><li>
longName is the name of the feature as shown in the api json file (admin access only).
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="log">3.5 Log</h2>
The “Log” page is where you enter your data on a regular basis over the course of the mission.
<br><br>

Some of these fields will be filled by api. Others will require your manual input.<br>
“SAVE” button lets you to accumulate your records over the course of the day (or several days) and then submit all these
data at once by clicking “SUBMIT” button.

</div>

<br><br>




<h2 id="view">3.6 View</h2>
The View page shows a spider-plot summary of your records 
(you need to save the Log data first in order to view this plot).
Red color shows your targets, blue is the latest recorded value
and yellow is the mean value over the course of the mission. All values are normalised to vary from 0 to 100%,
corresponding to min and max values, respectively, as indicated in the design tables.
The navigation circle in the top-right is to switch between targets, last records, and mean values on the spider-plot.

<h2 id="blog">3.7 Blog</h2>
You can create and edit your own blog-posts. You can read posts by others but cannot edit them. 
All registered users can read your posts, but they cannot edit or delete them 
(except the admin user, who can edit and delete any blogpost).

Private data ownership<br>
Any time users can download records collected on a Bundle-pod and then
delete the original copy on the server. Having these records downloaded and erased on a regular basis (e.g. after every
mission), makes sure that the remote server always holds only a minor fraction of the total records. Long-term records
belong to the user and they are kept safe on his or her local disks (perhaps, even disconnected from the network).
It is up to the user to share this data with kids, friends, GP, whoever (or just keep it private for himself).

<br><br>
<h1 id="appendixA">AppendixA: Missions and manifestations</h1>
<br><br>
Bundleverse provides a number of prebuilt missions and manifestations, readily available upon a registration. Each
of these missions can be customised further to fit requirements of the particular user. 
Manifestations are attached to these missions and provide
a visual representation of the mission. They also help track the progress achieved over the course of the mission. 
This section gives a short overview of these prebuilt missions and manifestations.
<br><br>

<h3>Missions></h3>
<br><br>

<i>Love My Mum</i>
This is a very simple mission – you promise to kiss, hug, and smile to your mum every day.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker</i>
The Tracker is based on weather APIs, so that you can log your own state and see if it has anything to do with the
changing weather. Beware, the weather API may not be particularly accurate at your location. 
If the uncertainty is too high, enter weather data manually. 
<br><br>

<i>Cardinal Virtues</i>
Historically cardinal virtues included temperance, fortitude, justice and prudence. Later spiritual virtues have been
added to this list (hope, humility, faith). Be creative, write up your own list is feel so.
<br><br>

<i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>
Seven deadly sins traditionally refer to 1. Lust 2. Gluttony 3. Greed. 4. Sloth 5. Wrath 6. Envy 7. Pride. As you can
see there is no direct correspondence between deadly sins and cardinal virtues.
<br><br>

<i>8-fold path</i>
Eight-fold path clearly can be refined and extended. Feel free to edit, especially if your are an expert. 
<br><br>

<i>Positive psychology</i>
Based on a science study by Seligman and Peterson (ref ...). 
<br><br>

<i>Explorer</i>
Explorer is a master mission which is meant to be easily reshaped to get other missions. 
It has been designed to reflect major
dimensions of a human being (and of course you can customise it to your own perception of these major dimensions).
Tables selected so far comprise 1. Environmental (weather) 2. Biophysical 3. Psychological (Emotional) 4. Intellectual 5.
Social (Ethical) 6. Spiritual 7 Transcendental dimensions.
The first Environmental dimension includes a weather APIs. Biophysical, Psychological, Intellectual and Social
dimensions roughly correspond to 4 cardinal virtues (Temperance, Fortitude, Wisdom, and Justice).
<br><br>


<i> Sizmarian personality</i>
The goal of this mission is to design and instantiate a new personality from scratch
(called sizmarian after the Georgian sizmari – dream).
The description of the sizmarian person must outline features characteristic of this personality 
and also describe practices specific to sizmarians. 
Note that we don’t
have to flesh out all the details of this personality upfront but instead we can start by making a draft 
outline (see dot points below), and then run 
it through the cycles of missions refining after each iteration.
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>
        Characteristic of sizmarians is some special state of Being (e.g. being cool, positive, caring, generous
        etcetera).
        This state of Being transcends all other features of sizmarians making them resistant to dogmatic teachings -
        sizmarians respect beliefs by others but when it comes to their own theories they take them easy, often with a
        touch of an irony.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians design and maintain their own afterlife (don’t know exactly how – be creative).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians run projects to make this world a better place (e.g. eradicate poverty, promote education, advance
        science, fight injustice etc).
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizmarians build and maintain digital twins of themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a sizmarian life is great - it is always bright and full of exciting surprises. Make no mistake here,
        sizmarians are
        aware of the suffering and misery permeating this world, but they also believe the broken parts 
        eventually will be fixed.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Manifestations</h3>
Mission manifestations established so far include Cube, City, Golem, Mermaid, Butterfly, Buddha. 

<br><br>
<h1 id="appendixB">AppendixB: Planes of the Reality</h1>
<br><br>

Missions can be interpreted in a number of ways. A mission can be considered a passive monitoring tool. 
For example the key function of "Tracker", is to monitor weather and self, in order to collect data and 
derive certain  conclusions from this data. An alternative interpretation of a mission, is a device helping us to 
populate this world with a fundamentally new entities created and maintained through missions.
Let me explain.   

<br><br>

First of all, 
let's take onboard the perspective of <a href="https://storiedmultiverse.github.io/"> Storied Multiverse. </a> 
According to Storied Multiverse, anything that have ever existed in the past 
or will exist in the future in this or any other possible world, has been designed, instantiated, and maintained 
by a human kind through the Instantiated Storied Object Machinery (ISOM).  
According to ISOM, to create a new entity one has to provide a
more or less coherent description of that entity, including the description of features characteristic of it, and also
define reproducible practices delivering these features. Having all these ingredients cooked up, one runs 
these practices to instantiate that entity. If features characteristic of that entity, are indeed delivered reliably,
through reproducible practices then whatever the description is it must be referring to the real entity. 
<br><br>

We can apply this schema to almost anything. The key point is to have a plausible description of something, 
and an outline of practices promising to deliver features  characteristic of it. These promises are then
tested through practices which either instantiate  that entity (thus proving it real), or vice versa,
fail to instantiate it (thus proving it an abstract, hypothetical construct).   
<br><br>

Bundleverse provides an infrastructure particularly suitable for implementing this schema. 
A Bundle if flexible enough to accommodate a relatively comprehensive description of an entity. 
The targets, specified through the bundle, define and chanel practices. Finally, the logging 
workflow facilitates implementation of practices and evaluation of the outcomes.
