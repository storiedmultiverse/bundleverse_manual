<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2 id="bundleverse">1.1 Bundleverse</h2>

Bundleverse software is a self-improvement web-application. 
It builds on the concept of Bundleverse defined as a collection of Bundles.

<br>
<h2 id="bundle">1.2 Bundle </h2>
A Bundle is a collection of properties which define any item residing in Bundleverse. 
Remember a bundle definition of a
person – every individual is a collection of properties, such as, for example, physical, biological, social,
psychological, spiritual etcetera. Get rid of all these properties and the person is gone. Analogously, in Bundleverse
everything is a Bundle of properties.
<br><br>

A Bundle is a description of an item - an information, or a knowledge about it. Unlike any information in general (e.g.
a theory, a story, a novel), the Bundle provides also instructions to follow in order to recover features characteristic of
the corresponding entity. In other words, Bundles have more in common with user-manuals rather than fiction-stories.
They tell us how to create, operate and maintain (or evolve) something.
<br><br>

Anyone in Bundleverse can design a new Bundle from scratch. Whether that new Bundle will underpin a new particular item 
(ie something really real, referred to as an instance of that Bundle) or it will
remain just an abstract theoretical construct, is to be seeing through practice. Instantiated Bundles reveal themselves
through various manifestations – an image, a function, a taste, a smell, experience etc. For many Bundles people are
hardwired with the right set of receptors to perceive these manifestations. In special cases the observer will
have to have a special training or education to be able to observe that Bundle.

<br><br>
In general, Bundles can
represent anything, but this document is concerned predominantly with Bundles 
representing human personalities. Such Bundles are dynamic,
evolving entities. They define who we are but also provide a description of our idealised, better self (and also 
inform us how to get there).  

<br><br>
To become a better person, we design some rules and instructions to follow. However, these rules and instructions
may not always work for us – i want to lose some weight, but cannot refuse a slice of the cake, someone 
wants to wake up early, but sleeps in, our goals could be misleading, our passions and feelings may bend our reasons. 
To figure
out which strategies work best for us and what kind of goals we really want to achieve, 
we can iterate and refine our practices
through the succession of short-term missions. At the start of every mission, we analyse outcomes from the previous
mission, and refine our goals and strategies to succeed in the following missions. 
After a number of iterations, we are likely
to have a better understanding of what we really want to achieve and how to get there.
<br><br>
Note that missions do not have to be exclusively about ourselves only. The goal of the 
mission could be, for example, the well-being of another person (or a group of people) we care about.
<br><br>


<h2 id="mission">1.3 Missions</h2>
A mission is a short-term iterative practice aiming at either self-improvement or care for others. 
Bundleverse provides a number of prebuilt missions readily available for the user upon a registration. Each
of these missions can be customised further to fit requirements of a particular person.

<br><br> 
Example of missions<br>
<i>Default</i>
This mission is to remind yourself that life is good (even if it is not) and you are cool, 
collected and calm regardless the state of your life right now. 
<br><br>

<i>LoveMyMum</i> The goal of this simple mission is to make sure you smile to your mum, 
kiss her and give her a hug al least once a day.
<br><br>

<i>Tracker.</i> Grandpa complaining that changing weather is causing him to have headaches. Bundleverse provides 
weather APIs to cross-correlate environmental indicators with the manual records of grandpa's state.
<br><br>

<i>Explorer.</i> 
The goal of this mission is to better understand your Self. The corresponding Bundle is intended as a comprehensive
description of the human nature (whatever the definition). The default, prefabricated version includes environmental,
bio-physical, psychological, intellectual, social, spiritual, and transcendental dimensions. Some
of these dimensions are delivered automatically via api, others require your manual input. After several weeks you may
start seeing patterns and correlations. Refine and iterate.
<br><br>

<i>Karma.</i> 
This mission builds on an Eightfold Path to Perfection from Buddhist teaching. 
The goal is to evolve your Self from the lower planes of the reality 
populated by the low-level life forms (golems and insects) to the higher realms populated by humans and gods.
<br><br>

<i>Psycho.</i>
According to positive psychology (Peterson and Seligman, 2004), six general categories of virtues are common across 
many different cultures. The goal of this mission is to track your positioning in the system of coordinates
established through this study.

Oxford University Press and Washington, DC - American Psychological Association.
 <br><br>

 Bundleverse provides a couple of basic visualisation tools helping the user to understand his or her data 
 accumulated over the course of the mission (see the View section below). 
 Besides that it offers the user qulitative means of tracking changes in his or her personality 
 (see Manifestations section below). 

<br><br>
 
<h1 id="frontend">2. NAVIGATION</h1>

<h2 id="registration">2.1 Registration</h2>
To design and run missions, the user must be registered with Bundleverse 
<a href="https:/bundleverse.com">https:/bundleverse.com</a>
<br><br>

<h2 id="workflow">2.2 Workflow</h2>
<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="Navbar2.png" alt="navbar">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>

Mission page. Login and select a mission from the “Mission” tab.
Update the list of manifestations if needed. <br>
Design page. Having a particular mission selected, go to the “Design” page to create a Bundle
template for that mission.<br>
Log page. Once you are happy with your Bundle template, go to the “Log” page to fill in this new Bundle with
data.<br>
The “View” page is to visualise and better understand your data.<br>
The “Blog” is to record anything that does not fit into the Bundle format (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET).<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="mission2">2.3 Mission</h2>
Bundleverse provides a number of pre-built, default missions, readily available upon a registration. The user can also
create his own missions. To create a new mission, enter a new name
into the current mission table, and click on the “LAUNCH” button. 
<br><br>

To download data for this mission on your local computer, click “DOWNLOAD” button on "Mission" page. 
This will download a zip file to your machine. Unzip it and look into "Features.ts" ASCI file. 
The data in this file is organised in columns with headers. 
The first column is time, the rest are features of your Bundle. Do whatever you like with this data, it is yours 
(e.g. visualise it, feed it to Neural Network, combine with other data, sell it, keep it, publish it etc.).

<br><br> 
To delete this mission, click “DELETE” button. This will erase from the server all
data accumulated over the course of your mission. If you intend to keep this data on your local PC, make sure you
download this mission first before deleting it.
<br><br>

Your progress through the mission is shown on the "Mission" page under the mission table. 
It is also illustrated through the changing opacity of the
manifestation stack under this plot (see the Manifestations section below for more details).

<div class="w3-main">

    <img src="missionA.png" alt="Mission" style="width:90%;height:90%;">
    <img src="missionB.png" alt="Mission" style="width:90%;height:90%;">
    <br>
    </center>
</div>


<h2 id="design">2.4 Design</h2>
To display a Bundle for the current mission, go to the “Design” page.<br>
To create a new Bundle for a new mission from scratch, again, go to the “Design” page. <br>
A Bundle is a collection of tables. Each table represents a particular property (e.g physical, biological,
social etc). Each table describes a collection of features assigned to that property (e.g. weight, diet, 
exercise etc.)
<br><br>
Note that saving a new bundle-template deletes all the earlier records and starts this mission again !!!
<br><br>

<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="design.png" alt="Design">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>

<br><br>

Every table has a title, space for comments, and feature fields.  
Every feature in the table is represented by 8 input text-fields:<br>
Feature, units, min, max, target, type, apiFile, and longName.
<ol> 
<li>    
Feature text-field shows a feature name (must be alphanumeric)
</li><li>
Units must not exceed 10 characters
</li><li>
Min is the minimum value of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 0 for a radio button.
</li><li>
Max is the maxim values of the feature (must be numeric). Set to 1 for the radio button.
</li><li>
Target is the desired target value to be achieved during the mission (must lie within the min-max range).
</li><li>
Type is either “text”, “radio” or “api”.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>
       “text” is a default type and indicates input text area
    </li><li>
       “radio” is for a checkbox, and
    </li><li>
       “api” is for an api input (to be provisioned by the admin)
    </li>
    </ol>

</li><li>
apiFile – is a name of the json file holding api data (admin access only). The data are to be generated by api script
(to be written by admin, and called regularly to get new data).
</li><li>
longName is the name of the feature as shown in the api json file (admin access only).
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="log">2.5 Log</h2>
The “Log” page is where you enter your data on a regular basis (e.g daily) over the course of the mission.
<br><br>

Some of these fields will be filled by api. Others will require your manual input.<br>
“SAVE” button lets you to accumulate your records over the course of the day (or several days) and then submit all these
data at once by clicking “SUBMIT” button (all such records are assigned a single timestamp at the submission time) 

<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="logging.png" alt="logging">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>

<br><br>


<h2 id="view">2.6 View</h2>
The View page shows a spider-plot summary of your records 
(you need to save the Log data first in order to view this plot).
Red color shows your targets, blue is the latest recorded value
and yellow is the mean value over the course of the mission. All values are normalised to vary from 0 to 100%,
corresponding to min and max values, respectively, as indicated in the design tables.
The navigation circle in the top-right is to switch between targets, last records, and mean values on the spider-plot.

<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="view.png" alt="view">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>


<br><br>

Curves. The Curves button redirects to the page with time-series of the recorded data. The data are normalised 
to vary between min and max as indicated in the design tables. The dash line represents the target values. 

<div class="w3-main">
    <center>
        <br>
        <img src="Curves.png" alt="Curves">
        <br>

</div>

<br><br>


Correlations. The Correlcharts button redirects to the page with correlations between between your records.


<div class="w3-main">
    <center>

        <img src="Correlations.png" alt="Correlations">
        <br>
    </center>
</div>
 
<br><br>

<h2 id="manifestations">2.7 Manifestations</h2>

Time series and correlations help you to monitor and understand your mission. Apart from that, 
Bundleverse provides a qualitative, visual representation of the progress you make during the mission. It shows 
how your personality changes over the course of the mission, by splitting your journey into the succession of steps, 
each step representing a particular stage of your evolving Self, visualised through (or associated with) 
a particular 3D digital environment or a model (called a manifestation of your personality). 
<br><br>

For example, "Karma" and "Explorer" are meant to evolve your Self from the lower 
planes of the reality populated by low-level life forms to the higher realms populated by humans and gods. 
Images of these planes stacked on top of each other are shown on the "Mission" page. 
Every image in the stack is a link redirecting to a 3D representation of the corresponding realm. 
By default, however, these links are inactive until activated 
by the user running the mission (i.e. the user has to log data to activate a link and access the environment 
behind that link). The longer she runs the mission, the higher she climb the stack of
manifestations and the larger number of links get activated (in other words, the more you evolve, 
the more realms open for you). The status of the links (active or deactivated) is indicated by the opacity 
of the corresponding image on the "Mission" page. 
<br><br>

        <img src="stack1.png" alt="Manifs_stack" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

        <br>
    </center>


<br><br>
Bundleverse  provides a range of prebuilt manifestations to select from and build your own 
stack to climb up during the mission. To update a stack, on the "Mission" page click "Show all" and then select 
a subset of manifestations by clicking on the corresponding icons. The ordering of the stack will be defined by 
the ordering of your selection. Save selected missions to redirect to the "Mission" page and then click on the 
"Launch" button to save the updated mission.

<h3 id="appendixA">Appendix A: Storied Multiverse interpretation</h3>

According to <a href="https://storiedmultiverse.github.io/overview/" target="_blank"> Storied Multiverse </a>, 
any item in 
in this world (or any other possible world), has been designed, instantiated, and maintained 
by a human kind through the Instantiated Storied Object Machinery (ISOM).  
According to ISOM, to create something new, one has to provide a
more or less coherent description of that entity (including the description of features characteristic of it) and also
define reproducible practices delivering these features. Having all these ingredients cooked up, one runs 
these practices to instantiate that entity. If successful then the description (however weird and unconventional) 
must be referring to something  real. 
<br><br>

This schema is applicable to almost anything. Once again, the key point is to have a plausible description of something, 
and an outline of practices promising to deliver features  characteristic of that something. These promises are then
tested through practices which either instantiate it (proving it to be real), or vice versa,
fail to instantiate it (thus proving it to be an abstract, hypothetical construct).   
<br><br>

Bundleverse provides an infrastructure particularly suitable for implementing this schema. 
The structure of Bundles is flexible enough to accommodate a relatively comprehensive description of features.
Targets and logging can facilitate practices. Bundleverse can help users to design and instantiate 
fundamentally new enteties which may have a range of possible applications.

<h3 id="appendixC">Appendix C: SkyBox multiplayer (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</h3>
SkyBox provides a 3D representation of your mission.
Is is built with <a href="https://threejs.org/">threejs.org</a> on top of the
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-3d-multi-player-game-using-threejs-and-socketio/">
    3D multiplayer game </a> from the online course material.

<br>
Still in early development stage.

<h3 id="appendixD">Appendix D: Shared mode (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</h3>
Having a mission established, you can run it in a private mode, or in a shared mode, or a compatitive mode. In a
private mode you care only about youself. In a shared mode you share your progress with others. In a compatitive mode
you compete with others.


<br><br>
By default a mission is private (as indicated in the bottom right corner of the mission table).
In a private mode you own your data and you are the only person running this mission and
responsible for the progress made through this mission. Other people may run a mission with the same titile
and even the same Bundle, but their mission and progress will be independent from yours.

<br><br>
For a shared mission, you still own your data, but you share the Bundle and the manifestation stack
with other people and they can now contribute to the progress you make through
the mission. For example, if Bob sets the mission to be shared, and Jane then joins this mission
(by launching a shared mission with the same title), then Bob and Jain run the same mission and they share progress.
Every time Jane logs to this mission, points are added to Bob's mission too (by incrementing his progress).
And vice verse, every time Bob logs to the mission, both his and Jane's progress gets incremented.
In a shared mission, when Bob and Jane log to the Skybox, they both share the same manifestation in the Skybox
(e.g. same "cube"). But the data, again,
remain private - Jane owns her data, and Bon owns his records. Only the indicators of the progress are shared.

<br><br>
Finally, in a compatittive mode, you share your Bundle and manifestation stack with others,
but keep you data and progress private.
